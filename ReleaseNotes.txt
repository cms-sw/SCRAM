	DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH to override runtime
	environment while building.

	path.

V2_2_4_pre5: 2012-05-23

	then scram now can ask tag collector the default/production arch for
	that project and then automatically create dev area for that.
	* Check for .SCRAM/arch/timestamps/self file for a valid release area.

V2_2_4_pre4: 2012-04-26

	* Allow nasted <architecture></architecture> blocks in tool files
	and BuildFiles.

	A new -e option is available which shows only valid projects i.e.
	which contain valid .SCRAM/$SCRAM_ARCH.
	* Automatically create a scram-based dev area if project is only
	available for one SCRAM_ARCH regardless of current SCRAM_ARCH.
	* Print error messages in to STDERR to avoid 'eval' processing.

	for osx SCRAM_ARCHs.

	definition is changed.
