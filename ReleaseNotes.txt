	* New SCRAM release series
	* Supports for multiple arch development under one user area.
	* Inital support for generating big objects files per shared lib/plugin
	* Auto cleanup for renamed products
	* No more .scramrc tool caches
	* No more .SCRAM/cache for tool caching
	* Tools are now public and available in config/toolbox for easy editing
	* No more colplecated tool setup process, just providing the tool name
	  or toolfile file is enough (no more version needed at command line)
	* More code clean up
	* More compact SCRAM internal caches (<500KB)
	* Faster "scram list" as it is not reading .SCRAM/Environment file for
	  all the installed projects
	* New RuntimeEnv module for setting up runtime environment. Now the
	changes you make b/w two "scram runtime" are not lost but they are move
	at the end of variable. e.g. 
	- After first "scram runtime" PATH will become
	  PATH=<values from scram>:<init value of PATH>
	- After you changes
	  PATH=<your name changes1>:<values from scram>:<init value of PATH>:<your name changes2>
	- After 2nd "scram runtime"
	  PATH=<values from scram>:<your name changes1>:<init value of PATH>:<your name changes2>
