2015-06-18 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* New filter 'ifversion' supported for toolfiles. Conditional
	flags can be set/remove based on a tool version e.g. in root 6 tool
        file one can have the following to disable capabilities 
	<ifversion name="^[6-9]\.">
          <flag NO_CAPABILITIES="yes"/>
        </ifversion>

	disabling accessing release information via internet.
	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm, SCRAM/CMD.pm: New 'scram config <key>[=<value>]'
	command to show/set site specific parameters; check for deprecated
	releases and refuse to create dev area is a release has been deprecated

	* Utilities/Verbose.pm: Send verbose errors.
	* CMSSW.pm: Look for state=IB in releases.map file for IBs
	default/production arch.
	 

2014-05-05 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: Use $CMS_PATH/common/cmsos to find out the OS
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Printout warning message if
	  - developer area is created for a non-production arch
	  - developer area arch and OS does not match
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: ARCH/OS mismatch check added for "scram build"
	  - Do not allow to build/compile if ARCH and OS mismatch

	Tag Collector to get the release archs.

2013-12-11 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/BuildFile.pm: Print error messages for unknown attributes
	or missing files attribute for test/plugsin BuildFiles.
	* BuildSystem/MakeInterface.pm: Exit with non-zero code even with -k option.
	At the end of build print an error message to show that there were some build
	errors.
	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: For scram runtime command, always set PATH which
	forces the shell to discard it cache and re-search for binaries again. This will
	avoid running rehash (tcsh) or force setting PATH (bash).

2013-07-26 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* Configuration/ConfigArea.pm: Fixed logic for searching the arch of a release
	area. This allows to have + char in path.

2013-05-27 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: For project tool e.g. cmssw, convert any
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2013-04-08 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: "scram list <version>" can now match all available versions which
        match <version>. If no version is matched for $SCRAM_ARCH then other archs are
	also search. If SCRAM_ARCH is forced via command-line e.g. "scram -a <arch> list <ver>"
	then <ver> is only searched for <arch>.
	* BuildSystem/MakeInterface.pm: Cleanup gmake options. Every non-recognized

	and now we only read xml BuildFiles.
	* SCRAM/Helper.pm: Updated "scram build" help message.
	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: Dropped unused spawnarch() function. This was used in
	old days to re-run scram for a different SCRAM_ARCH but there is no need

	scram dbs linked in too.
        * SCRAM/CMD.pm: When requesting to create a dev area, if release is
	not available for current SCRAM_ARCH then show a warning mesage.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: As SCRAM is now arch independenct, so do not stop
	is if scram is not available an arch.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: For "scram db" command use writeable DB path.
	* bin/scram: Override writable SCRAM DB path too is SCRAM_USERLOOKUPDB
	is set.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Bug fix, use basename instead of dirname to get the project version

2013-03-13 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* Copy tool files first in to dev area to make sure their timestamp
	is earlier then the timestamp files in .SCRAM/<arch>/timestamp dir.

2013-03-12 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/DocParser.pm: Catch all error thrown while parsing the
	tool files.
	* Configuration/ConfigArea.pm: Use config/config_tag file to have the
	config tag and use this tag as config checksum.
	
2013-02-13 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/ToolParser.pm,BuildSystem/ToolManager.pm,bin/chktool:
	Avoid using SCRAM_PATH_VARIABLES environment variable.

2013-02-07 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/ToolManager.pm, BuildSystem/ToolParser.pm, SCRAM/SCRAM.pm:
	- Treat PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
	and PYTHONPATH as path type variables for tool definition.
	- Do not allow to set the above variables for <client><environment/></client>
	as this can override runtime environment. 
	* bin/chktool: New tool added to test a tool definition.

2012-12-17 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* Cache/CacheUtilities.pm: No more dependency on Compress::Zlib and 
	always use gzip.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Set LOCALTOP environment at the time of project setup
	so that tools which want to set variables pointing to project area can
	properly do so.

2012-10-16 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/Template/Plugins/PluginCore.pm: Add utility functions
	to add default product is missing.

	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm: Check for .SCRAM/arch/timestamps/self file
	for a valid release area.
	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm: bug fix, .SCRAM/arch/timestamps/self is
        file not directory. This effected "scram list -e" output.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Bug fix, for "scram p <path>". <path> should be an
	absolute.

2012-05-07 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* CMD.pm: Command-line option --all added for "scram list"
	to see all available projects for all archs.
	* CMD.pm: "scram project" now can optionally talk to tag collector
	to get the production arch for a release. This helps creating dev
	area if project is available for multiple SCRAM_ARCHs

2012-04-26 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/BuildFile.pm, BuildSystem/ToolParser.pm:
	Do not save un necessary items in ProjectCache.db
	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm: Make use of <path>/*/etc/default-scramv1-version
	to find out the installed arch instead of a un necessary
	<path>/etc/scramrc/*.arch files.

2012-04-25 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Convert LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	to DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH for osx SCRAM_ARCHs.
	* BuildSystem/ToolData.pm: Do not duplicate LIBDIR/INCLUDE
	paths in dev area if path value does not depend on release
	location.

2012-02-13 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm, SCRAM/Helper.pm, SCRAM/CMD.pm:
	New option -e to show only projects which actually exist.
	* BuildSystem/BuildFile.pm, BuildSystem/Product.pm,
	BuildSystem/ToolParser.pm: Allow multiple/nasted arch sections

2012-02-07 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* bin/scram: Updated to have original SCRAM_ARCH value saved.
	* BuildSystem/ToolManager.pm: Print errors on STDERR so the
	eval `scram run -sh` can show them.
	* Configuration/ConfigArea.pm, SCRAM/CMD.pm, SCRAM/SCRAM.pm:
	Now scram automatically switch arch depending on area arch e.g.
	if dev/release area has only one arch then scram will set
	SCRAM_ARCH to match that instead of complaining.
	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm: Regardless of SCRAM_ARCH, if release
	is only available for one arch then do not complain and create
	dev area for that arch.

2012-01-12 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Allow to run "scram project <version>".

	read and write path for SCRAM link.db.

2011-10-18 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm: Allow to show patch and partial
	build projects via "scram list" too. Make sure there are no
	duplicate links in links.db.

2011-10-14 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL.txt: updated install instructions.
	* bin/scram: cleanup, no more local login for calculating

	updates.
	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm: New DB less SCRAM updates. Now
	SCRAM configuration is read from <cmspath>/etc/scramrc area
	e.g. links file under this can contain path of other SCRAM
	areas projects/<PROJECT_NAME> file can contain the relative
	path to search under <cmspath>/<SCRAM_ARCH> for install
	projects (e.g. CMSSW file can have cms/cmssw/CMSSW_*).
	* Utilities/AddDir.pm: Bug fix, copy all files except '.' and
	'..'.

	* Cache/Cache.pm: Re-creation of scram internals caches in case
	they get corrupted.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Checks added to make sure that scram internal
	caches are valid. If cache files are corrupted then re-create 
	them. Support added to unset the runtime environment
	(scram unsetenv -csh).
	SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Support added for unset runtime
	environment and skip setting runtime environment path for which
	symlinks are created in the release/dev area.

2010-01-11 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Fix for extra optional environment variables.
	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: No more SCRAMRT_* backup environment
	variables are created to suppose old SCRAVM V1 versions. Backup
	environment variables are now saved with a prefix of SRT_ to avoid

	environment are added.

2009-11-23 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: Warning message are now sent to STDERR so that eval 
	do not try to execute the error message itself.

2009-10-06 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/BuildDataStorage.pm: Make sure the BuildFile exists before
	parsing it.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Do not read the DirCache.db if -f option is used. This
	will allow o run "scram build -f clean" if DirCache.db is corrupted.
	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Cleanup, Runtime.db was read twice.

2009-03-18 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/ToolParser.pm: Fixed the interactive tool setup for variables
	which are already set as runtime environment.

2009-02-16 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* Cache/CacheUtilities.pm: Used Data::Dumper to store SCRAM cache which
	is portable for different arch.

2008-09-17 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Print an error message when --update is passed for a
	scram project command. --update option was broken since long and now
	scram prints an error message when this option is used.
	* SCRAM/Helper.pm: Updated the help message for project command.

2008-09-16 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/ProjectChkSum.pm: Checksum is calculated by first sorting
	the files names in order to get uniq chksum for different arch.
	
2008-09-15 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>
	
	* BuildSystem/Product.pm: The file="name" attrib of library/bin tag from
	the BuildFile is saved as it is in the generated rules i.e SCRAM is not
	going to expand *.cc in to individual file names. This will
	automatically build newly added .cc files without updating the BuildFile.
	
2008-09-09 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Improved env backup so that current SCRAM
	releases should be able to correctly re-use the env backup of future
	releases.

2008-08-27 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* Cache/Cache.pm: Added hack to load SCRAM::Plugins::DirCache to do project
	specific stuff. This will help for big library generation.

2008-08-14 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Fix for setting env on Mac because on Mac
	setting backups for variables like DYLD_* were causing some trouble. Fix
	for setting up env from SCRAM V1 project first and then SCRAM V2 project.

2008-07-30 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: An error message printed out at stderr to inform
	developer that the release top for his/her dev. area has been
	removed/unusable.

2008-07-22 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Now scram runtime does not wipe out the
	new variables set b/w two scram runtimes.

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Bug fixed which was causing the "scram list proj vers"
	to fail.

2008-06-25 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: Replaced "USE" with "use" which is a valid perl key
	word. Due to this scram was failing when SCRAM_ARCH was not set.

2008-06-20 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Fixed to print out proper error message when
	"scram project name version" commnad is run with name/version which
	does not exist.

2008-06-18 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/BuildDataStorage.pm,BuildSystem/TemplateInterface.pm:
	Basic biglib support added, the changes will not break old SCRAM
	releases.

2008-06-16 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Do not skip LOCALRT env variable.
	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: Do not set LOCALRT here, it was set by  self tool,
	make all fetal messages go to stderror, local RuntimeEnv perl module
	dynamically so that we can pick it up from project release area too,
	warning message added when try to create a dev area which already
	exists.
	
2008-06-06 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm,BuildSystem/MakeInterface.pm: Fixed to run
	 default gmake if "gmake" is not setup as an external tool.

2008-06-02 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* Cache/Cache.pm: Disable the non-xml BuildFile read warning.

2008-05-21 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Bug fix, scram setup now setup all the tools if no
	tool name is provided on the command-line.

2008-05-15 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/Attic/RuntimeEnv.pm: Do not set SCRAMRT_* and *_SCRAMRT
	backup variavles when doing "scram build" and also then do not set the
	environment when "scram b" is called recursively.

2008-04-21 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/Template/Plugins/PluginCore.pm: Bug fixed for flags which 
	are arch specific.
	* Cache/CacheUtilities.pm: Switch to use gzip if Compress::Zlib perl
	module is not installed.

2008-04-14 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* BuildSystem/BuildDataStorage.pm: Fixed the bug when package level
	src directory is deleted and there is only BuildFile left in the
	package directory.

2008-04-07 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugin/RuntimeEnv.pm: Cleanup.
	* BuildSystem/MakeInterface.pm: Run with full path to avoid picking
	it up from /usr/bin area.

2008-04-02 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugin/RuntimeEnv.pm: Now saves the tools runtime in 
	.SCRAM/<arch>/RuntimeEnvCache.db.gz file. Every time an external tool
	is changes (ToolCache.db.gz) file changes then this
	RuntimeEnvCache.db.gz file will be update too.
	It also now prints a warning message when it tries to setup
	runtime environment on top of a already set SCRAM V1 environment.
	* Configuration/ConfigArea.pm: Do not copy RuntimeEnvCache.db.gz 
	when creating a developer area.

2008-04-02 Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* SCRAM/Plugin/RuntimeEnv.pm: Newly added module for setting runtime
	environment.
	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm, SCRAM/CMD.pm: Fixed to use new SCRAM::Plugin::RuntimeEnv
	for setting up the runtime environment.
	Now scram runtime behaviour is
	like this e.g for PATH runtime variable
	- At first "scramv1 runtime -csh", it will
	  - backup all the env variables it is going to modify with
	  the values set by scram
	    PATH => PATH_SCRAMRT=<values_set_by_scram>
	  - backup all the env variables with their initial values
	    PATH => SCRAMRT_PATH=<init_value_of_PATH>
	  - set the env variable with new values
	    PATH=<values_set_by_scram>:${SCRAMRT_PATH}
	- Now if you make changes in env after doing "scram runtime"
	  PATH=<your_new_changes1>:${PATH}
	  PATH=${PATH}:<your_new_changes2>
        - Next time when you do "scramv1 run" then it will set
	  - PATH_SCRAMRT=<values_set_by_scram>
	  - SCRAMRT_PATH=<value of ${PATH} with ${PATH_SCRAMRT} removed from it>
	  - PATH=<values_set_by_scram>:${SCRAMRT_PATH}
	  So in this case you will end up with
	  PATH=<values_set_by_scram>:<your_new_changes1>:<init_value_of_PATH>:<your_new_changes2>
	In case if the initial environment was set by SCRAM V1_x or V0_X then
	the next "scram runtime" will behave as old SCRAM i.e. changes you
	made after first "scram runtime" will be lost.
