	</iftool>

2018-09-14 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* BuildSystem/ToolData.pm: In dev area, for self package, only add those
	directories (from release area) in path type variables which actuall
	exists. This allows to reduce the path e.g. do not add poison dir
	from release area in CMSSW_SEARCH_PATH if it does not exist.

2018-08-29 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Allow to unset some envionment variables during
	scram build e.g. LD_PRELOAD. This is needed as during 'scram build' scram
	unsets existing env and then reset it to the current project version.
	During these two events if LD_PRELOAD remains set then any system call
	made by scram fails.

2017-10-31 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* BuildSystem/ToolParser.pm, BuildSystem/ToolData.pm: allow toolfiles to have

	errors.
	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: For scram runtime command, always set PATH which
	forces the shell to discard it cache and re-search for binaries again. This will
	avoid running rehash (tcsh) or force setting PATH (bash).

2013-07-26 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* Configuration/ConfigArea.pm: Fixed logic for searching the arch of a release
	area. This allows to have + char in path.

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: As SCRAM is now arch independenct, so do not stop
	is if scram is not available an arch.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: For "scram db" command use writeable DB path.
	* bin/scram: Override writable SCRAM DB path too is SCRAM_USERLOOKUPDB
	is set.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Bug fix, use basename instead of dirname to get the project version

2013-02-07 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* BuildSystem/ToolManager.pm, BuildSystem/ToolParser.pm, SCRAM/SCRAM.pm:
	- Treat PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
	and PYTHONPATH as path type variables for tool definition.
	- Do not allow to set the above variables for <client><environment/></client>
	as this can override runtime environment.

	for a valid release area.
	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm: bug fix, .SCRAM/arch/timestamps/self is
        file not directory. This effected "scram list -e" output.
	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Bug fix, for "scram p <path>". <path> should be an
	absolute.

2012-05-07 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* CMD.pm: Command-line option --all added for "scram list"
	to see all available projects for all archs.
	* CMD.pm: "scram project" now can optionally talk to tag collector
	to get the production arch for a release. This helps creating dev
	area if project is available for multiple SCRAM_ARCHs

2012-04-26 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* BuildSystem/BuildFile.pm, BuildSystem/ToolParser.pm:
	Do not save un necessary items in ProjectCache.db

	eval `scram run -sh` can show them.
	* Configuration/ConfigArea.pm, SCRAM/CMD.pm, SCRAM/SCRAM.pm:
	Now scram automatically switch arch depending on area arch e.g.
	if dev/release area has only one arch then scram will set
	SCRAM_ARCH to match that instead of complaining.
	* SCRAM/ScramProjectDB.pm: Regardless of SCRAM_ARCH, if release
	is only available for one arch then do not complain and create
	dev area for that arch.

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Improved env backup so that current SCRAM
	releases should be able to correctly re-use the env backup of future
	releases.

2008-08-27 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* Cache/Cache.pm: Added hack to load SCRAM::Plugins::DirCache to do project
	specific stuff. This will help for big library generation.

2008-08-14 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Fix for setting env on Mac because on Mac
	setting backups for variables like DYLD_* were causing some trouble. Fix
	for setting up env from SCRAM V1 project first and then SCRAM V2 project.

2008-07-30 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: An error message printed out at stderr to inform
	developer that the release top for his/her dev. area has been
	removed/unusable.

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Bug fixed which was causing the "scram list proj vers"
	to fail.

2008-06-25 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: Replaced "USE" with "use" which is a valid perl key
	word. Due to this scram was failing when SCRAM_ARCH was not set.

2008-06-20 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Fixed to print out proper error message when
	"scram project name version" commnad is run with name/version which
	does not exist.

2008-06-18 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* BuildSystem/BuildDataStorage.pm,BuildSystem/TemplateInterface.pm:
	Basic biglib support added, the changes will not break old SCRAM
	releases.

2008-06-16 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm: Do not skip LOCALRT env variable.
	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm: Do not set LOCALRT here, it was set by  self tool,
	make all fetal messages go to stderror, local RuntimeEnv perl module
	dynamically so that we can pick it up from project release area too,
	warning message added when try to create a dev area which already
	exists.
	
2008-06-06 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/RuntimeEnv.pm,BuildSystem/MakeInterface.pm: Fixed to run
	 default gmake if "gmake" is not setup as an external tool.

2008-06-02 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* Cache/Cache.pm: Disable the non-xml BuildFile read warning.

2008-05-21 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/CMD.pm: Bug fix, scram setup now setup all the tools if no
	tool name is provided on the command-line.

2008-05-15 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/Plugins/Attic/RuntimeEnv.pm: Do not set SCRAMRT_* and *_SCRAMRT
	backup variavles when doing "scram build" and also then do not set the
	environment when "scram b" is called recursively.

2008-04-21 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* BuildSystem/Template/Plugins/PluginCore.pm: Bug fixed for flags which 
	are arch specific.
	* Cache/CacheUtilities.pm: Switch to use gzip if Compress::Zlib perl
	module is not installed.

2008-04-14 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* BuildSystem/BuildDataStorage.pm: Fixed the bug when package level
	src directory is deleted and there is only BuildFile left in the
	package directory.

2008-04-07 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/Plugin/RuntimeEnv.pm: Cleanup.
	* BuildSystem/MakeInterface.pm: Run with full path to avoid picking
	it up from /usr/bin area.

2008-04-02 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/Plugin/RuntimeEnv.pm: Now saves the tools runtime in 
	.SCRAM/<arch>/RuntimeEnvCache.db.gz file. Every time an external tool
	is changes (ToolCache.db.gz) file changes then this
	RuntimeEnvCache.db.gz file will be update too.
	It also now prints a warning message when it tries to setup
	runtime environment on top of a already set SCRAM V1 environment.
	* Configuration/ConfigArea.pm: Do not copy RuntimeEnvCache.db.gz 
	when creating a developer area.

2008-04-02 Shahzad Muzaffar  <@smuzaffar>

	* SCRAM/Plugin/RuntimeEnv.pm: Newly added module for setting runtime
	environment.
	* SCRAM/SCRAM.pm, SCRAM/CMD.pm: Fixed to use new SCRAM::Plugin::RuntimeEnv
	for setting up the runtime environment.
	Now scram runtime behaviour is
	like this e.g for PATH runtime variable
	- At first "scramv1 runtime -csh", it will
	  - backup all the env variables it is going to modify with
	  the values set by scram
	    PATH => PATH_SCRAMRT=<values_set_by_scram>
	  - backup all the env variables with their initial values
	    PATH => SCRAMRT_PATH=<init_value_of_PATH>
	  - set the env variable with new values
	    PATH=<values_set_by_scram>:${SCRAMRT_PATH}
	- Now if you make changes in env after doing "scram runtime"
	  PATH=<your_new_changes1>:${PATH}
	  PATH=${PATH}:<your_new_changes2>
        - Next time when you do "scramv1 run" then it will set
	  - PATH_SCRAMRT=<values_set_by_scram>
	  - SCRAMRT_PATH=<value of ${PATH} with ${PATH_SCRAMRT} removed from it>
	  - PATH=<values_set_by_scram>:${SCRAMRT_PATH}
	  So in this case you will end up with
	  PATH=<values_set_by_scram>:<your_new_changes1>:<init_value_of_PATH>:<your_new_changes2>
	In case if the initial environment was set by SCRAM V1_x or V0_X then
	the next "scram runtime" will behave as old SCRAM i.e. changes you
	made after first "scram runtime" will be lost.
